# Banking App Demo

This repository contains a single-file SwiftUI proof-of-concept that demonstrates
how a lightweight banking client can talk to a local TCP server, generate
credit-card like records, and visualise the activity inside a modern SwiftUI
interface.

> **Note**
> The project is intentionally self-contained. Drop the two Swift source files
> (`BankApp.swift` and `Persistence.swift`) into a new Xcode SwiftUI app target
> to try the experience on macOS or iOS.

## Features

- **SwiftUI dashboard** – Interactive controls to start/stop the embedded bank
  server, trigger card generation, and review all generated cards.
- **Networking demo** – A simple TCP `BankServer` built with `Network` feeds
  generated cards back to a `BankClient`, showing how to marshal JSON requests
  and responses.
- **Luhn validation** – All card numbers are created with a Luhn checksum so the
  examples resemble real-world card data.
- **Persistent history** – Generated cards and activity logs are automatically
  saved to disk and restored on launch using the new `PersistenceController`.
- **Actionable insights** – A summary section highlights card totals, combined
  balances, and average balances for a quick health check.
- **Activity log** – Every important event (server activity, client responses,
  generation outcomes, and administrative actions) is recorded with timestamps.
- **Management tools** – Clear the saved cards or wipe the activity log directly
  from the toolbar menu.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new SwiftUI app project in Xcode (macOS or iOS target).
2. Replace the autogenerated `ContentView.swift` and `App` files with the
   provided `BankApp.swift`. Add `Persistence.swift` to the same target.
3. Build and run. The app will boot the local TCP server automatically on first
   appearance. Use the controls to generate cards locally or through the server.

## Repository Layout

```
.
├── BankApp.swift       # SwiftUI interface, server/client demo, and domain models
├── Persistence.swift   # JSON-backed persistence for cards and log entries
├── README.md           # Project overview and usage instructions
└── LICENSE             # MIT License
```

## Suggested Improvements

- Persist additional metadata such as the remote host information or connection
  statistics for each generated card.
- Add unit tests for the Luhn helper and persistence layer.
- Introduce multiplatform layouts that adapt the UI for compact width devices.
- Provide an export feature so users can share the generated card list as CSV.

Feel free to build on this starter to explore more advanced SwiftUI patterns or
networking workflows.
